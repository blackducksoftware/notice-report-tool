NoticeReportTool v0.5

Tool generates a HTML Notice file based on the identifications made for the project.  The output will
contain an entry for each BOM Component.  Each entry will have links to display: 
i) all paths ID-ed to the Component (if option is selected)
ii) all copyright strings extracted from the text files identified to it (if option is selected)
iii) all licenses identified to the component and ability to display text

The tool can also generate a text file for each component (if option is selected)

Before running,

Edit the config.properties file:

*protex.uri: Full URL of the Protex server e.g https://protextraining.blackducksoftware.com

*protex.username: username of the Protex account to run the SDK operations e.g jatoui@blackducksoftware.com

*protex.password: clear text password for the user account above

*project.name: name of project in Protex for which this report is generated

*license.filenames: Comma separated list of filenames which denote license files.  
For the Protex project Scan Configuration need to have Upload File Option=true for the pattern or file type

*copyright.patterns: Denotes the name of the Protex String Searches capturing the copyright information.  
Feel free to add more or erase the ones not applicable in your instance.  Please note that “SPDX: Copyright” will need Regex String Searches to be enabled which is not by default. 

*show.component.version:  true or false value to indicate if you want the component version shown on the report

*show.file.paths:  true or false value to indicate if you want the list of identified files on the report

*show.copyrights: true or false value to indicate if you want copyright statements to appear on the report

*include.license.filenames.in.report: true or false to indicate if you want the license.filenames listed above to appear on the report

*output.filename: Notice report output HTML filename

*text.file.output: true or false to indicate if you would like to have the tool output separate notices text files for each component.
This will create a new folder named ./"project.name"_text_files and place all the notices files in there

~~~~~~NOTE: To get the most comprehensive report, both show.file.paths and show.copyrights should be set to true. The tools needs to
link a copyright match to a file path, in order to get any license info from it.


To run:

java -jar NoticeReportTool.jar
